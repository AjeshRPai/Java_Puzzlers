	/**
	 * Because neither operand is of type String, the + operator performs addition rather than string concatenation.
	 *
	 * The compiler evaluates the constant expression ’H’ + ’a’ by promoting each of the char-valued operands (’H’ and ’a’) to int values through a process known as widening primitive conversion [JLS 5.1.2, 5.6.2].
	 * Widening primitive conversion of a char to an int zero extends the 16-bit char value to fill the 32-bit int.
	 * In the case of ’H’, the char value is 72 and in the case of ’a’,
	 *
	 * it is 97, so the expression ’H’ + ’a’ is equivalent to the int constant 72 + 97, or 169.
	 *
	 *
	 *  The + operator performs string concatenation if and only if at least one of its operands is of type String
	 *
