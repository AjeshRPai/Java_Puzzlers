	/**
	 * compile-time constants of type String are interned
	 *  In other words, any two constant expressions of type String
	 *  that designate the same character sequence are represented by identical object references
	 *
	 *
	 *  If initialized with constant expressions, both pig and dog would indeed refer to the same object,
	 *  but dog is not initialized with a constant expression.
	 *  The language constrains which operations are permitted to appear in a constant expression
	 *  and method invocation is not among them
	 *
	 *
	 *  The + operator, whether used for addition or string concatenation, binds more tightly than the == operator.
	 *  System.out.println(("Animals are equal: " + pig) == dog);
	 *
	 * When using the string concatenation operator, always parenthesize nontrivial operands.
