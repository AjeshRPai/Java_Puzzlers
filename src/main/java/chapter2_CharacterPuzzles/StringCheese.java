	/**
	 * The culprit here is the String(byte[]) constructor.
	 * Its specification says: “Constructs a new String by decoding the specified byte array using the platform’s default charset.
	 * The length of the new String is a function of the charset, and hence may not be equal to the length of the byte array.
	 * The behavior of this constructor when the given bytes are not valid in the default charset is unspecified”
	 *
	 *
	 * What exactly is a charset? Technically, it is “the combination of a coded char- acter set and a character-encoding scheme”
	 *
	 * In other words, a charset is a bunch of characters, the numerical codes that represent them,
	 * and a way to translate back and forth between a sequence of character codes and a sequence of bytes.
	 * The translation scheme differs greatly among charsets.
	 * Some have a one-to-one mapping between characters and bytes; most do not.
	 *
	 *
	 * Summary
	 * every time you translate a byte sequence to a String, you are using a charset, whether you specify it explicitly or not
	 *
