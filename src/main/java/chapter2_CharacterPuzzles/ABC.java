	/**
	 *
	 * If the reference is null, it is converted to the string "null".
	 * Otherwise, the con- version is performed as if by an invocation of the toString method of the referenced object with no arguments;
	 * but if the result of invoking the toString method is null, then the string "null" is used instead
	 *
	 * Arrays inherit the toString method from Object [JLS 10.7], whose specification says, “Returns a string consisting of the name of the class of which the object is an instance, the at-sign character ’@’,
	 * and the unsigned hexadecimal representation of the hash code of the object” [Java-API].
	 * The specification for Class.getName says that the result of invoking this method on the class object for char[] is the string "[C".
	 * Putting it all together gives the ugly string printed by our program
	 *
	 *
	 *
	 To summarize, char arrays are not strings. To convert a char array to a string, invoke String.valueOf(char[]).
