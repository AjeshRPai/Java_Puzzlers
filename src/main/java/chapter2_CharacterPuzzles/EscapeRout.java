	/**
	 * Java provides no special treat- ment for Unicode escapes within string literals.
	 * The compiler translates Uni- code escapes into the characters they represent before it parses the program into tokens,
	 * such as strings literals [JLS 3.2].
	 * Therefore, the first Unicode escape in the program closes a one-character string literal ("a"),
	 * and the second one opens a one-character string literal ("b").
	 *
	 * The program prints the value of the expression "a".length() + "b".length(), or 2.
	 *
	 *
	 * ASCII is the lowest common denominator of character sets.
	 * ASCII has only 128 characters, but Unicode has more than 65,000.
	 * A Unicode escape can be used to insert any Unicode character into a program using only ASCII characters.
	 *
	 *  prefer escape sequences to Unicode escapes in string and character literals.
	 *  Unicode escapes can be confusing because they are processed so early in the compilation sequence.
	 *  Do not use Unicode escapes to represent ASCII characters.
