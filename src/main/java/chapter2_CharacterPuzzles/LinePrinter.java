	/**
	 * This program contains a single Unicode escape (\u000A), located in its sole
	 * comment. As the comment tells you, this escape represents the linefeed character, and the compiler duly translates it before discarding the comment.
	 * Unfortunately, this linefeed character is the first line terminator after the two slash characters that begin the comment (//) and so terminates the comment [JLS 3.4].
	 * The words following the escape (is Unicode representation of linefeed (LF)) are therefore not part of the comment; nor are they syntactically valid.
	 *
	 *
	 *
	 * To make this more concrete, here is what the program looks like after the Uni- code escape has been translated into the character it represents:
	 *    public class LinePrinter {
	 *        public static void main(String[] args) {
	 *           // Note:
	 *     is Unicode representation of linefeed (LF)
	 *            char c = 0x000A;
	 *      System.out.println(c); }
	 * }
	 *
	 *
	 *
	 * Solution
	 *
	 *  public class LinePrinter {
	 *        public static void main(String[] args) {
	 * char c = ’\n’;
	 * System.out.println(c); }
	 * }
	 * Once this has been done, the program will compile and run, but it’s still a questionable program.
	 * It is platform dependent for exactly the reason suggested in the puzzle.
	 * On certain platforms, such as UNIX, it will print two complete line separators; on others, such as Windows, it won’t.
	 *
