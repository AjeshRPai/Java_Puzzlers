	/**
	 * The first bug is that the random number is chosen so the switch statement can reach only two of its three cases.
	 * The specification for Random.nextInt(int) says:
	 * “Returns a pseudorandom, uniformly distributed int value between 0 (inclusive) and the specified value (exclusive)” [Java-API].
	 * This means that the only possible values of the expression rnd.nextInt(2) are 0 and 1.
	 * The switch statement will never branch to case 2,
	 * which suggests that the program will never print Gain. The parameter to nextInt should have been 3 rather than 2.
	 *
	 *
	 * there are no break statements between the cases.
	 * Whatever the value of the switch expression, the program will execute that case and all subsequent cases [JLS 14.11].
	 * Each case assigns a value to the variable word, and the last assignment wins.
	 * The last assignment will always be the one in the final case (default), which is new StringBuffer(’M’).
	 * This suggests that the program will never print Pain or Gain but always Main.
