/**
 * The problem is in the third line of the comment, which contains the characters \ -units.
 * These characters begin with a backslash (\) followed by the letter u, which denotes the start of a Unicode escape.
 * Unfortunately, these characters are not followed by four hexadecimal digits, so the Unicode escape is ill-formed, and the compiler is required to reject the program.
 * Unicode escapes must be well formed, even if they appear in comments.
 *
 *
 *
 * SUMMARY
 *
 * In summary, ensure that the characters \  u do not occur outside the context of a valid Unicode escape,
 * even in comments. Be particularly wary of this problem in machine-generated code.
