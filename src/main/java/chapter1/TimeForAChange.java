	 * The problem is that not all decimals can be represented exactly using binary floating-point.
	 *
	 * Binary floating-point is particularly ill-suited to monetary calculations,
	 * as it is impossible to represent 0.1—or any other negative power of 10—exactly as a finite-length binary fraction
	 *
	 * In summary, avoid float and double where exact answers are required; for monetary calculations, use int, long, or BigDecimal.
