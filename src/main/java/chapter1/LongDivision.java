	 * The problem is that the computation of the constant MICROS_PER_DAY does overflow.
	 * Although the result of the computation fits in a long with room to spare,
	 * it doesn’t fit in an int.
	 * The computation is performed entirely in int arithmetic,
	 * and only after the computation completes is the result promoted to a long.
	 * By then, it’s too late: The computation has already overflowed, returning a value that is too low by a factor of 200
	 *
	 * So why is the computation performed in int arithmetic? Because all the factors that are multiplied together are int values.
	 * When you multiply two int values,
	 * you get another int value. Java does not have target typing,
	 * a language feature wherein the type of the variable in which a result is to be stored influences the type of the computation.

	 * It’s easy to fix the program by using a long literal in place of an int as the first factor in each product.
	 * This forces all subsequent computations in the expres- sion to be done with long arithmetic.
	 * Although it is necessary to do this only in the expression for MICROS_PER_DAY, it is good form to do it in both products.
	 * Similarly, it isn’t always necessary to use a long as the first value in a product, but it is

	 *
	 *
	 * When working with large numbers, watch out for overflow—it’s a silent killer.
	 * Just because a variable is large enough to hold a result doesn’t mean that the computation leading to the result is of the correct type.
	 * When in doubt, perform the entire computation using long arithmetic.
