	/**
	 * negative decimal constants are clearly identifiable by the presence of a minus sign.
	 * Not so for hexadecimal and octal literals.
	 * They can take on both positive and negative values.
	 * Hex and octal literals are negative if their high-order bit is set.
	 *
	 *
	 *The lesson of this puzzle is that mixed-type computations can be confusing,
	 *  more so given that hex and octal literals can take on negative values without an explicit minus sign.
