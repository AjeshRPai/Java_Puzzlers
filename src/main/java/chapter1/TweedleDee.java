	 *
	 * Compound assignment operators require both operands to be primitives, such as int, or boxed primitives,such as Integer,
	 * with one exception: The += operator allows its right-hand operand to be of any type if the variable on the left-hand side is of type String,
	 * in which case the operator performs string concatenation [JLS 15.26.2].
	 * The simple assignment operator (=) is much less picky when it comes to allowing object reference types on the left-hand side:
	 * You can use them to your heartâ€™s content so long as the expression on the right-hand side is assignment
	 * compatible with the variable on the left
