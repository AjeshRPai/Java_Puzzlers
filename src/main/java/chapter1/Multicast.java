	 * Sign extension is performed if the type of the original value is signed;
	 * zero extension if it is a char, regardless of the type to which it is being converted.
	 *
	 * Because byte is a signed type, sign extension occurs when converting the byte value 1 to a char.
	 * The resulting char value has all 16 bits set, so it is equal to 216  1,
	 * or 65,535. The cast from char to int is also a widening primitive conversion,
	 * so the rule tells us that zero extension is performed rather than sign extension. The resulting int value is 65535,
