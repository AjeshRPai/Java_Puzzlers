	/***
	 * The rules for determining the result type of a conditional expression are too long and complex to reproduce in their entirety,
	 * but here are three key points.
	 * 1. If the second and third operands have the same type, that is the type of the conditional expression.
	 * In other words, you can avoid the whole mess by steering clear of mixed-type computation.
	 * 2. If one of the operands is of type T where T is byte, short,
	 * or char and the other operand is a constant expression of type int whose value is representable in type T,
	 * the type of the conditional expression is T.
	 * 3. Otherwise, binary numeric promotion is applied to the operand types,
	 * and the type of the conditional expression is the promoted type of the second and third operands.
	 *
	 *
	 * Therefore, point 2 applies to
	 * the first expression and its return type is char. Point 3 applies to the second condi- tional expression,
	 * and its return type is the result of applying binary numeric pro- motion to int and char, which is int
	 *
	 * For the first expression, PrintStream.print(char) is invoked; for the second, PrintStream.print(int)
	 *
