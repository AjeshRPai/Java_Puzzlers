	/**
	 *
	 *  The value of the expression j++ is the original value of j before it was incremented.
	 *  Therefore, the preceding assignment first saves the value of j,
	 *  then sets j to its value plus 1, and,
	 *  finally, resets j back to its original value.
	 *
	 *
	 *  Summary
	 *  Do not assign to the same variable more than once in a single expression.
	 *  An expression containing multiple assignments to the same variable is confusing and seldom does what you want.
